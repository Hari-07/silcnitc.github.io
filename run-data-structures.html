                        <p>
                            This document explains how the compiler allocates memory for variables in a program. First it is necessary to understand the requirements and the underlying theoretical concepts in some detail.
                        </p>
                        <h4>The storage allocation Problem </h4>
                        <p>
                            A program contains global variables as well as variables that are local to functions, both requiring memory space. Of these, global variables are the simplest to handle because during the analysis phase we know how many global variables are there in the program (all global variables are declared) and how much space needs to be allocated for each of them (why?). Thus, the storage requirements for global variables are completely determined at compile time and they can be assigned memory addresses during the analysis phase itself. Such allocation is called <b>static allocation</b>. The binding field of the global symbol table entry for a variable  is set to the memory address allocated to the variable. This symbol table information will be used during the code generation to find out the location in memory where the variable is stored.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the analysis phase the compiler <b>will not</b> decide on the addresses in the <i>code area</i> of memory where the function's code is loaded. Hence, the compiler cannot fix the address to which function must be attached. To handle this issue, the compiler will assign a <b>pseudo address</b> to each function, which will be stored in the binding field of the function's global symbol table entry. All calls to the function will be translated to a call to this pseudo address. The correct addresses will be assigned late during the <b>label translation</b> phase.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Variables which are local to functions demand more complicated allocation. This is because a function may be invoked several times and <i>for each invocation, separate storage needs to be allocated for variables defined within the scope of the function</i> (i.e., local variables and arguments).  [Why?] Moreover, we do not know during the analysis phase how many times a function will be invoked during the execution phase.  [Why?]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To understand this, consider the factorial program below.
                        </p>
                        <script src="js/f0127bf97757874e7cc2.js"></script>
                        <p>
                            The function factorial contains an argument n. Suppose the initial value of n input by the user at run time was 5, then factorial(n) with n=5 is invoked from the main. This function invokes factorial(n) with n=4. However, we need to retain the old value of n since the orginal factorial function must resume execution after the completion of factorial(4). Thus, we cannot statically assign a fixed memory address to the variable n. Instead, for each invocation of the function, we need to create a different memory space for storing the value of n. Moreover, the initial value of n given by the user is not known at compile time. Hence cannot determine at compile time the exact storage requirement. We will have to design the compiler/interpreter to allocate memory space as is necessary during run time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to allocating storage for  local variables and arguments, additional storage needs to be allocated at run time for each invocation of a function to store the return values of the call and control information like a pointer to the next instruction in the calling function (return address)].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The classical solution to handling function invocation is to maintain a <b>run time stack</b>. Whenever a function is invoked during execution, <b>an activation record</b> is created in the run time stack with sufficient space for storing local variables, arguments, return values and return address and the stack grows. Upon return from the function, the activation record is popped out of the stack and the activation record of the calling program will be in the top of the stack. Thus, at each point during execution, the activation record of the currently executing function will be on the top of the stack. Such storage allocation is called <b>stack based run time allocation</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            [Note:  The semantics of ExpL makes stack based allocation possible.  Primarily, this is possible because data stored in an activation record can be forgotten once the execution of the call is finished.    There are languages like LISP which permit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function">higher order functions</a> where a stack based run time allocation is not possible.  Languages which permit stack based run time allocation for function invocations are said to follow <b>stack discipline</b>.]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Observe  that for each function defined in an ExpL program, the amount of storage needed in its activation record is known during the analysis phase.  [Why?]   What is not known is how many activation records will have to be created in the stack as this is known only during execution time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to allocating storage for global variables and variables local to functions, ExpL supports <b>dynamic memory allocation</b> through the alloc() function. The alloc() function allows a program to request for memory space at run time. Since the amount of memory requested is not known during the analysis phase (why?), static allocation is not possible in this case. Stack allocation also is ruled out because memory allocated by alloc() inside a function is not de-allocated when the function returns. Hence, a mechanism to dynamically allocate memory on demand at run time is required.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The classical solution to this problem is to maintain an contiguous area of memory called the heap memory from which memory is allocated by alloc() on demand. Heap management algorithms like the <b>fixed size allocator algorithm</b> and the <b>buddy system algorithm</b> are explained in detail later in this documentation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, intermediate values generated during program execution needs <b>temporary storage</b>. For example, while evaluating an expression (a+b)*(c+d), the values of the sub-expressions (a+b) and (c+d) might need temporary storage. In a compiler, the <b>machine registers</b> are used for temporary storage.  Our interpreter will simulate the compiler by having an array of “registers” for storing such temporary values. When a function invokes another function, the registers in current use will be pushed to the stack (activation record of the caller) so that the called function (callee) has the full set of registers free for its use. Upon return from the callee, the values pushed into the stack are restored to the registers before the caller resumes its execution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To summarize, we have four kinds of memory allocation – static, stack, heap and register (temporary). The data structures and algorithms necessary for implementing each of these are discussed below.

                        <h2>The memory model</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our interpreter will simulate machine memory and registers by defining three memory arrays, named  <i>stack, heap and registers</i>.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The basic unit of memory (called a <b>memory word</b>) is assumed to be able to store an integer or a string.  This model is assumed because the primitive data types of ExpL are integer and string.  The interpreter therefore defines the following memory structure:
                        </p>
                        <script src="js/2e982915b856ce98791b.js"></script>
                        <p>
                            The interpreter works with three arrays of memory words, to implement temporary storage (registers), the run time stack and the heap. There will be no sperarate memory array for static data. Instead,  the intial part of the stack will be used for storing static data.
                        </p>
