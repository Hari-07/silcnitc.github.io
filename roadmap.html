                        <h2>Using the Roadmap</h2>
                        <p>
                            This roadmap is divided into several stages, to be done in sequential order. Incrementally you will build a compiler for the ExpL language according to its specification. Links are provided for background reading material wherever appropriate. It will be assumed that you have background in C programming, Data Structures and Principles of Computer Organization.

                        <h2>Stage 0 : Installation and Preparation</h2>
                        <p>
                            <b>Pre-requisites</b>: NIL<br>
                        	In this stage, you will download and familiarize yourself with the simulation package and learn the compiler design software tools LEX and YACC.  Follow the instructions below.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li id="otis">1.  Install the LEX, YACC and the XSM simulator package.  Follow the instructions <a href="install.html" target="_blank">here</a></li>.
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You need to learn two software tools - YACC and LEX which you will use in the project. These tools are somewhat
                            sophisticated. Fortunately, understanding what is enough for the purpose of our compiler project is not very difficult. The following tutorials will help you through this process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are not already familiar with the tools LEX and YACC do the following:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li id="otis">2.  Complete the <a href="lex.html" target="_blank">LEX tutorial</a>.</li>
                                <li id="otis">3.  Complete the YACC following <a href="yacc.html" target="_blank">tutorial</a>.</li>

                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next step is to understand the target machine envionment. You must carefully go through the following tutorial
                            before proceeding to the next stage of this roadmap.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5.  Complete the <a href="xsm-environment-tut.html">XSM execution environment tutorial</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With this, you are ready with all the required pre-requisites to proceed further in this roadmap.

                            <b>Learning Objectives</b>:<br/>
                            <p>In this stage, you will:</p>  
                            <ul>
                            <li id="otis">1.  Parse an input  arithmetic expression and create and expression tree using YACC and LEX.</li>
                            <li id="otis">2.  Recursively traverse the tree and generate assembly language code.  You learn to solve the <i>register allocation problem</i> enroute.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The strategy of the roadmap is to help you build the compiler in stages.  We start here by building a compiler for simple arithmetic expressions. In subsequent stages, we will add more features of the language by one, learning the relevant theoretical concepts along the way. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this stage, you will implement a very simple compiler that can take an arithmetic expression as input (from some input file)  and generate a target executable file containing XSM instructions to evaluate the expression and output the result.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We assume that you have implemented the library routine for handling console output, which you were asked to do in the <a href="xsm-environment-tut.html" target="_blank">XSM execution environment tutorial</a>.  
                        </p>
                        <p>                            
                            Consider arithmetic expressions with the following syntax.
                            <div class="syntax">
                                E :  E + E | (E) | NUM  
                            </div>
                            Where the <a href="lex.html#navyytext" target="_blank">lexeme</a> <b>NUM</b> correspond to integers.  Assume left <a href="yacc.html#associativity" target="_blank">associativity</a>  for '+'. Thus, the <a href="lex.html#token" target="_blank">tokens</a> relevant are NUM and +. The attribute value associated with a number is the number read.  Assume that the input file is passed as argument to the main() function in YACC.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The lexer must pack the attribute into a tree node of the following structure:
                           <div class="syntax">         
                            typedef struct tnode{<br>
                            &emsp;int val;            //The result of evaluation of sub expression rooted at this node<br>
                            &emsp;char *op;           //indicates the name of the opertor for a non leaf node<br>
                            &emsp;struct tnode *left,*right;      //left and right branches<br>
                            }tnode;<br>
                            <br>
                            #define YYSTYPE tnode*
                            </div>
                      <!--       Specifiy YYSTACK type:  /* Give  tree node definition just sufficient for this purpose, explaining why each field is required */ -->   
                            Since the semantics actions in the parser must build the tree, the following function must be written:
                            <div class="syntax">
                            /*Make a leaf tnode and set the value of val field*/<br/>
                            struct tnode* makeLeafNode(int n);<br/>
                            <br/>
                            /*Make a tnode with operator, left and right branches set*/<br/>
                            struct tnode* makeOperatorNode(char c,struct tnode *l,struct tnode *r);
                            </div>  
                            <!-- TreeCreate(...)  function to create tree – Again, just enough for the purpose, explaining arguments.   -->
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Task 1</b>:  Build the expression tree for the given input.<br>
                            <b>Exercise 1</b>:  Output the prefix and postfix forms of the expression from the tree.<br>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            (Note:  You would have already completed this task if you have done the <a href="ywl.html" target="_blank"> Using Yacc With Lex tutorial </a>).
                        </p>
                        <p>    
                            Now, comes the next task - to generate assembly language program equivalent for the expression and write it out into an executable file in the XEXE format.  Once this is done, you can use the simulator to load the XEXE file into the memory of the XSM machine and execute it as outlined in the <a href="xsm-environment-tut.html"> XSM run time environment tutorial</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To do this, one needs to know the following:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li id="otis">1. The machine model and the <a href="abi.html#nav-XSM-instruction-set">instruction set</a> of the target machine.</li>
                                
                                <li id="otis">2. Format of the <a href="abi.html#nav-XEXE-executable-file-format"> executable file</a>.</li>
                                
                                <li id="otis">3. You need to know the address in the memory (in the target machine) where each instruction you generate will be loaded (by the OS loader). This is because program control instructions like JMP, CALL etc.,  requires specification of the jump address. <br>
                                
                                As already outlined in the XSM enviornment tutorial[LINK], the header will be loaded into addresses 2048-2055. The first instruction generated by you will be loaded to the address 2056. Each XSM instruction occupies 2 memory words. Hence, the next instruction will be loaded at address 2058 and so on. The entry point field of the header must contain the address of the first instruction to be fetched and executed.</li>

                                <li id="otis">4. You need fix the memory addresses where variables and other data is stored. For example, for each variable in the program, the compiler will have to allocate storage space in memory. The ABI stipulates that the region for this is the <a href="abi.html#nav-virtual-address-space-model"> stack region</a>. Thus each variable must be stored in some address between 4096 and 5119.</li>

                                <li id="otis">5. Since XSM machine stipulates that arithmetic and logic instructions can be done only when operands are loaded into machine registers, we need to load the contents of variables/constants in the program into the machine registers before processing them. This brings in the problem of register allocation. The XSM machine makes available 20 registers (R0-R19) for the compiler.</li>   
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of the above, the XSM execution environment tutorial has already explained (1) and (2). Evaluation of expressions do not involve either storage allocation or program control transfer (JMP). Hence, we will not take up (3) and (4) at this stage. However, we need to solve (5) now. 
                        </p>
                        <p><h3>What must be the evaluation strategy?</h3></p>
                        <p>
                            Let us take an example:<br><br>

                            If you are given a two node expression tree as shown below corresponding to the expression (3+2):<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <img src="img/tree1.png">
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The evaluation strategy will be:
                            <ul>
                                <li id="otis">1.  Store 3 in a register – say R0.</li>
                                <li id="otis">2.  Store 2 in a register – say R1.</li>
                                <li id="otis">3.  ADD R0, R1.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>               
                            The result will be stored in R0 and is sufficient for us. To generate code for the above tasks and write it into a target_file, you must write code as:  

                        <div class="syntax">
                            fprintf(target_file, "MOV R0, 3");<br>
                            fprintf(target_file, "MOV R1, 2");<br>
                            fprintf(target_file, "ADD R0, R1");<br>
                        </div>

                            However, life becomes complicated if we have an expression like (3+2)+(5+6) resulting in the following tree.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <img src="img/tree2.png">
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course, we can “hand craft” this case also.  But the strategy will not generalize. The basic issue is that your compiler does not know the input expression before-hand.  Technically speaking, the issue is that the “expression is not available at <b>compile time</b>, but only known at <b>run time</b>”. Your code generation module must be more <i>“intelligent”</i> to handle <i>arbitrary expressions</i>.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The root of the problem in the code above is that R0 and R1 has been picked by you and not your compiler.Thus, we must have a <b>register allocation policy</b> (basically a function) that returns a free register whenever we require one. That is, you must design the following functions:
                        </p>
                        <div class="syntax">
                            int getReg()   //  Allocate a free registers
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>
                            That returns the register number of an unallocated register, so that your code for adding 3 and 2 would look like:
                        </p>

                        <div class="syntax">
                            int p = getReg();<br>
                            int q = getReg();<br>    
                            fprintf( target file, “MOV R%d, 3”, p);<br>
                            fprintf(target_ file, “MOV R%d, 2”, q);<br>
                            fprintf(target_file, “ADD R%d, R%d,”, p,q);<br>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            In addition to allocating registers, you must also have mechanism to <b>release a register</b> back into the register pool. In the above example, after the ADD instruction is generated R1 can be released and send back to the register pool.    
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For this purpose, you will write a function
                        </p>
                        
                        <div class="syntax">
                            freeReg() //  Releases a register.  
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>
                            To make the allocation  strategy simple,  we suggest that you  generate target code in such a way that  <i>the result of a CPU instruction involving two registers</i> will be always stored in the register with lower index. The above code, for example, stores result of the above computation is kept in R0 and not R1 so that the register with the higher index value can be released. As a consequence, the freeReg() function does not require any arguments.  Instead, freeReg() and getReg() can be designed to keep track of the highest numbered register allocated so far and hence can keep track of the correct register that must be allocated or freed.   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The following summarizes the register allocation strategy:
                        </p>
                        <div class="syntax">
                            1. Whenever a register is needed, allocate the lowest numbered register that is free. (Thus, give R0 if possible, otherwise R1 etc.)<br>

                            2.  Whenever we free a register, always release the highest used register.  Thus was allocated previously.  (Thus, if R0, R1 and R2 were allocated, freeReg() must release R2).
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>
                            Finally, we must design a code generation module.  The strategy here is to start with an expression tree and do the following:
                        </p>

                        <div class="syntax">
                            1.  At the leaf nodes of the tree (corresponding to a NUM),  Allocate a new register and store the number to the register.<br>
                            2.  At the intermediete nodes :<br>
                            &emsp;a.  Generate code for the left subtree (recursively). Find out the register holding the result.<br>
                            &emsp;b.  Evaluate the right subtree (recursively). Find out the register holding the result.<br>
                            &emsp;c.  ADD the contents of the two registers and store the result in the lower numbered register.<br>
                            &emsp;d.  Release the higher numbered register and return.<br>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            In the above box, as step 2.a and 2.b requires finding the index of the register which stores the result of expression evaluation. The simplest strategy is to design a codeGen() function that can take as input an expression tree and generates code for the expression, <i>returning the index of the register storing the result</i> :  
                        </p>
                        <div class="syntax">
                            #define reg_index int;<br>  
                            reg_index codeGen( struct node *t) {<br>
                            &emsp;..<br>
                            &emsp;..<br>
                            &emsp;return [result-regIndex]<br>   
                            }
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The codeGen() function takes as input a pointer to the root of an expression tree and generates code for the subtree rooted at that node. After generating code, the function must return the index of the register storing the result. See this <a href="codegen.html" target="_blank">link</a> for furthur details.

The result of expression evaluation may be stored in the first location of the stack region – memory address 4096.  Note that the XEXE executable format must be adhered so that the XSM simulator can load and execute the file.

                            then space will have to be allocated in memory.  We will not address this contingency in this roadmap.  If register pool is exhausted, your compiler may stop compilation and flag "Out of registers"  error.

                         <p>
                            Consider a simple programming language with the following syntax:
                            <div class="syntax">
                                Program ::= BEGIN Slist END<br>
                                <br>
                                Slist ::=  Slist Stmt<br>
                                <br>
                                Stmt ::= InputStmt |  OuptputStmt | AsgStmt<br>
                                <br>
                                InputStmt ::= READ(ID);<br>
                                <br>
                                OutputStmt ::== WRITE(E);<br>
                                <br>
                                AsgStmt ::==  ID = E;<br>
                            </div> 
                            Apart from the <a href="lex.html" target="_blank">literal tokens</a>, BEGIN, END, READ, and WRITE are tokens corresponding to keywords “begin”, “end”, “read” and “write”.  ID is a token for variables.  We will permit only variables [a-z].
                         </p>
                         <p>
                            To support variables to appear in expressions, you must add the rule <b>E := ID</b> to the expression syntax used in Stage 1. The above syntax defines a small programming language that permits just straight line programs (programs without conditionals, loops, jumps or such control transfer constructs). There are only 26 pre-defined variables that are supported – a, b,c,..,z. A typical program would look like:
                            <div class="syntax">
                                begin<br>
                                &emsp;read (a);<br>  
                                &emsp;read (b);<br>
                                &emsp;d = a + 2 * b;<br>
                                &emsp;write (a+d);<br>
                                end;   
                            </div>
                         </p>
                         <p>
                            We will assume that variables can store only integers. Handling variables of multiple types will be taken up in subsequent stages.<br><br>  

                            A conceptual point to note here is that apart from the addition of variables, the extended language now has two kinds of constructs – expressions and <b>statements</b>. While an expression evaluates to a value (in this case, we limit ourselves to integer expressions), a statement commands the execution of some action by the machine. For example, the statement <i>read(a);</i> instructs the action of reading a variable from the console into a variable a. <i>write(a+d);</i> instructs evaluation of the expression (a+d) and printing the result into the console output.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another important conceptual point to note is that the introduction of variables also demand binding <span style="color: red;">[Dangerous area! - we will give Wiki link!]</span> them to storage (memory) locations. The storage location associated with a variable must hold the value of the variable at each point of program execution. A statement (like the assignment statement or a read statement) that alters the value of a variable must result in a change the value stored in the corresponding storage location.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the present case, the compiler can fix the address for each variable in memory right at the time of program compilation. Since the ABI stipulate that storage allocation must be done in the stack region, we can pre-allocate the first 26 memory locations in the stack region of <a href="abi.html#nav-virtual-address-space-model" target="_blank">memory</a> for the variables a-z. Thus, variable a will refer to contents of address 4096, b to contents of address 4097 and so on. Any time the compiler encounters the variable – say a, the address to be looked at is fixed – in this case 4096. Such allocation policy is called <b>static allocation</b>. In later stages you will encounter situations where it will not be possible for the compiler to fix memory address of a variable at compile time. This leads to <b>run time</b> and <b>dynamic memory allocation</b> policies. For now, we will be content with static allocation.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            To implement the above, your compiler must:
                            <ul>
                                <li id="otis">1. Fix the storage location for each variable. As noted above, the first 26 locations of the stack region starting at address 4096 may be assigned for a to z. Note that the XSM machine can store an integer in a single memory location. Hence, for each variable we need to allocate only 1 memory word. Note that "allocation" here means that while generating code, the compiler assumes when it generates code that the variable a is stored in location 4096, b in location 4097 and so forth.</li>

                                <li id="otis"><b>Note</b> : Some programming languages stipulate that variables must be initialized to zero.  In that case, the compiler must generate code to MOV 0 to each of these locations before generating code for statements in the program. Some machines provide machine instructions that support initializing memory to zero.  Certain operating systems would have initialized all memory regions (except those to which code is loaded into) to zero at load time.  We will not pursue these issues here.</li>

                                <li id="otis">2. To translate an assignment statement, the compiler must generate code evaluate the expression and then MOV the contents of the register storing the result to the memory location allocated for the variable.</li>

                                <li id="otis">3. To translate a Read statement, the compiler must generate code to invoke the <a href="abi.htmll#nav-lowlevel-syscall-interface" target="_blank">read system call</a> passing the address of the variable as argument. Write is implemented similarly.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But before getting into code generation, we must create an <b>abstract syntax tree (AST)</b> for the program.  An abstract syntax tree is a tree representation of the program, just like an expression tree for expressions. An abstract syntax tree for the above program would look like the following:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <img src="img/ast_stage2.png">
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Observe that each node now needs to store distinguishing information like:
                            <ul>
                                <li id="otis">1. Whether it corresponds is a variable, constant, operator, assignment statement, write statement or read statement.</li>
                                <li id="otis">2. In case of operators, the information on the operator must be present.</li>
                                <li id="otis">3. There are also connector nodes which simply connects two statements together.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This leads to the definition of the following node structure:  
                            <script src="js/dd1979bba5d35250a0c9419520a6b5b8.js"></script>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Task 1</b> : Use Yacc and Lex to generate abstract syntax tree representation of a program. A file containing the source program will be input to your program.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thus, after parsing, we use the syntax directed translation scheme of YACC to construct an intermediate representation – namely, the abstract syntax tree. This phase of compilation is sometimes called the <b>front end</b> of the compiler. The next step is to recursively traverse the expression tree to generate executable code.  This is typically called the <b>back end</b>. The output of the front end is generally a <b>machine independent intermediate representation</b> like the AST. The back end of course will be dependent on the target platform.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Task 2</b> : Modify CodeGen() function of Stage 1 to generate code for the abstract syntax tree generated as Task 1 above.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the next stage, we will see how program control instructions like if-then-else can be incorporated into the language.

                            <b>Note</b> : An abstract syntax tree is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation" target="_blank">intermediate representation</a> of the source program in a tree from suitable for code generation. There are several other forms of intermediate representations like the three address code form, the static single assignment form etc. This roadmap will be based on the abstract syntax tree representation.

                            In commercial strength compilers, the source is first translated to intermediate forms like the three address form which is a bit more of a <b>low level representation</b> than the AST. Typically machine independent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimizing_compiler" target="_blank">code optimizations</a> are performed on the intermediate code and only then the back-end code generation is run. This step is followed by another set of machine dependent code optimizations before the target file is finally generated. As these issues are beyond the scope of our project, we will not dwell into these matters further in this roadmap.

                            <b>Exercise 1</b> : Build an <b>evaluator</b> for the program. (Hint: Your front end does not change. But, instead of generating code from the AST, you can recursively "evaluate" it. For storage allocation of variables, you can simply declare an array that can store 26 integers and allocate one entry for each variable).

                            <b>Note</b> : The compiler generates target code which must be executed by the target machine. In our case, the compiler you wrote as Task 2 actually is a <b>cross compiler</b>. This means that your compiler generated target code that is not for your host system, but on some other target platform – which in our case the simulated XSM machine. The evaluator done in Exercise 1 actually does not generating "code" for any machine. Instead, it executes the program in "then and there". Such a program could be classified as an <b>interpreter</b>. (Unfortunately, the standard terminology in literature associated with the term "interpreter" seems to be contradictory to this classification).
