                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The strategy of the roadmap is to help you build the compiler in stages.  We start here by building a compiler for simple arithmetic expressions. In subsequent stages, we will add more features of the language by one, learning the relevant theoretical concepts along the way. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this stage, you will implement a very simple compiler that can take an arithmetic expression as input (from some input file)  and generate a target executable file containing XSM instructions to evaluate the expression and output the result.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We assume that you have implemented the library routine for handling console output, which you were asked to do in the XSM execution environment tutorial.  
                        </p>
                        <p>                            
                            Consider arithmetic expressions with the following syntax.
                            <div class="syntax">
                                E :  E + E | (E) | NUM  
                            </div>
                            Where the <a href="lex.html#navyytext" target="_blank">lexeme</a> <b>NUM</b> correspond to integers.  Assume left <a href="yacc.html#associativity" target="_blank">associativity</a>  for '+'. Thus, the <a href="lex.html#token" target="_blank">tokens</a> relevant are : NUM and +. The attribute value associated with a number is the number read.  Assume that the input file is passed as argument to the main() function in YACC.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The lexer must pack the attribute into a tree node of the following structure:
                           <div class="syntax">         
                            typedef struct tnode{<br>
                                int val;            //value of for the expression tree<br>
                                char *op;           //indicates the opertor branch<br>
                                struct tnode *left,*right;      //left and right branches<br>
                            }tnode;<br>
                            <br>
                            #define YYSTYPE tnode*
                            </div>
                      <!--       Specifiy YYSTACK type:  /* Give  tree node definition just sufficient for this purpose, explaining why each field is required */ -->   
                            Since the semantics actions in the parser must build the tree, the following function must be written:
                            <div class="syntax">
                            /*Make a leaf tnode and set the value of val field*/<br/>
                            struct tnode* makeLeafNode(int n);<br/>
                            <br/>
                            /*Make a tnode with operator, left and right branches set*/<br/>
                            struct tnode* makeOperatorNode(char c,struct tnode *l,struct tnode *r);
                            </div>  
                            <!-- TreeCreate(...)  function to create tree – Again, just enough for the purpose, explaining arguments.   -->
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Task 1</b>:  Build the expression tree for the given input.<br>
                            <b>Exercise 1</b>:  Output the prefix and postfix forms of the expression from the tree.<br>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            (Note:  You would have already completed this task if you have done the <a href="ywl.html" target="_blank"> tutorial </a>).
                        </p>
                        <p>    
                            Now, comes the next task - to generate assembly language program equivalent for the expression and write it out into an executable file in the XEXE format.  Once this is done, you can use the simulator to load the XEXE file into the memory of the XSM machine and execute it as outlined in the XSM run time environment tutorial [LINK].
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To do this, one needs to know the following:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li id="otis">1. The machine model and the <a href="abi.html#nav-XSM-instruction-set">instruction set</a> of the target machine.</li>
                                
                                <li id="otis">2. Format of the <a href="abi.html#nav-XEXE-executable-file-format"> executable file</a>.</li>
                                
                                <li id="otis">3. You need to know the address in the memory (in the target machine) where each instruction you generate will be loaded (by the OS loader). This is because program control instructions like JMP, CALL etc.,  requires specification of the jump address. <br>
                                
                                As already outlined in the XSM enviornment tutorial[LINK], the header will be loaded into addresses 2048-2055. The first instruction generated by you will be loaded to the address 2056. Each XSM instruction occupies 2 memory words. Hence, the next instruction will be loaded at address 2057 and so on. The entry point field of the header must contain the address of the first instruction to be fetched and executed.</li>

                                <li id="otis">4. You need fix the memory addresses where variables and other data is stored. For example, for each variable in the program, the compiler will have to allocate storage space in memory. The ABI stipulates that the region for this is the <a href="abi.html#nav-virtual-address-space-model"> stack region</a>. Thus each variable must be stored in some address between 4096 and 5119.</li>

                                <li id="otis">5. Since XSM machine stipulates that arithmetic and logic instructions can be done only when operands are loaded into machine registers, we need to load the contents of variables/constants in the program into the machine registers before processing them. This brings in the problem of register allocation. The XSM machine makes available 20 registers (R0-R19) for the compiler.</li>   
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of the above, the XSM execution environment tutorial has already explained (1) and (2). Evaluation of expressions do not involve either storage allocation or program control transfer (JMP). Hence, we will not take up (3) and (4) at this stage. However, we need to solve (5) now. 
                        </p>
-------------------------------------------------------TILL HERE----------------------------------------------------------
                        <p><h3>What must be the evaluation strategy?</h3></p>
                        <p>
                            Let us take an example:<br><br>

                            If you are given a two node expression tree as shown below corresponding to the expression (3+2):

                            /* Tree here */

                            The evaluation strategy will be:

                            1.  Store 3 in a register – say R0 .
                            2.  Store 2 in a register – say R1
                            3.  ADD R0, R1.

                            The result will be stored in R0 and is sufficent for us.  

                            To generate code for the above tasks and write it into a target_file, you must write code as:  

                            <div class="syntax">
                                fprintf(target_file, “MOV R0, 3”);<br/>
                                fprintf(target_file, “MOV R1, 2”);<br/>
                                fprintf(target_file, “ADD R0, R1”);<br/>
                            </div>

                            However, life becomes complicated if we have an expression like (3+2)+(5+6) resulting in the following tree.

                            Figure
                        </p>
                            <p>
                                Of course, we can handle this case also.  But the strategy will not generatlize because our compiler does not know the input expression before-hand.  Technically speaking, we speak about this issue as  “expression is not available at compile time, but only known at run time”.   Your code generation module must be more intelligent to  generate code for an arbitrary expression.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The root of the problem in the code above is  that R0 and R1 has been picked by you and not your code.<br>
                                Thus, we must have a register allocation policy (basically a function) that returns a free register whenever we require one. Basically, you must write the following functions:
                            </p>
                            <div class="syntax">
                            int getReg()   //  Allocate a free registers
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>That returns the register number of an unallocated register, so that you can look like:  </p>

                            <div class="syntax">
                                int p = getReg();<br>
                                int q = getReg();<br>    
                                fprintf( target file, “MOV R%d, 3”, p);<br>
                                fprintf(target_ file, “MOV R%d, 2”, q);<br>
                                fprintf(target_file, “ADD R%d, R%d,”, p,q);<br>
                            </div>

                            <p>
                                In addition to allocating registers, you must also have mechanism to release a register back into the register pool. In the above example, after the ADD instruction is generated R1 can be released and send back to the register pool.    
                            </p>

                            <p>For this purpose, you will write a functions</p>
                                <div class="syntax">
                                freeReg() //  Releases a register.  
                                </div>
                            <p>
                                To make the allocation  strategy simple, we will generate target code in such a way that  the result of a CPU instruction involing two registers will be always stored in the register with lower index.    The above code, for example, stores  result of the above computation is kept in R0 and not R1 so that the register with the higher index value can be released.    This means that the freeReg() function does not require any arguments.  Instead, freeReg() and getReg() can be designed to keep track of the higest numbered register allocated so far and hence can keep track of the right register that must be allocated or freed.  

                            The following summarizes the register allocation strategy [Link Register Allocation documentation]:  
                            </p>
                            <pre>
                            1 Whenever a register is needed, allocate the lowest numbered register that is free.  (Thus, give R0 if possible, otherwise R1 etc.)  

                            2.  Whenever we free a register, always release the highest used register.  Thus was allocated previously.  (Thus, if R0, R1 and R2 were allocated, freeReg() must release R2).

                                Finally, we must design a code generation module.  The strategy here is to start with an expression tree and do the following:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
                            1.  At the leaf nodes of the tree (corresponding to a NUM),  Allocate a new register and store the number to the register.
                            2.  At the intermediete nodes :
                                a.  Generate code for the left subtree (recursively);  find out the register holding the result.
                                b.  Evaluate the right subtree (recursively); find out the register holding the result.
                                c.  ADD the contents of the two registers and store the result in the lower numbered register
                                d.  Release the higher numbered register and return.
                            </pre>

                            <p>
                                In the above box, as step 2.a and 2.b requires finding the index of the register which stores the result of expression evaluation, the simplest strategy is to make the codeGen() function return the index of the register storing the result.  This leads to the following definition of the getReg() function:  
                             </p>
                            <pre>
                            #define reg_index int;  
                            reg_index codeGen( struct node *t) {
                              ..
                              ..
                              return [result-regIndex]   
                            }
                            </pre>
                        </p>
