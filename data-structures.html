                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>
                            The compilation/interpretation of an ExpL program involves two phases. In the first phase (called the <b>analysis phase</b>), the source ExpL program is analyzed (lexical, syntax and semantic analysis are completed in this phase) and if the program is free of syntax and semantic errors, an intermediate representation of the source program called the <b>abstract syntax tree</b> is generated. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is followed by a second phase, whose functionality is different for a compiler and an interpreter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the case of a compiler, the second phase (called the <b>synthesis phase</b>) recursively traverses the abstract syntax tree and generates target code. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            [<b>Note</b>: the abstract syntax tree representation is only one among several intermediete representations used in practical compilers. “Lower level” intermediete representations like three address code are often more useful for applying code optimization algorithms. In our present experiment, we do not perform any code optimizations and hence the code generation phase will directly work with the abstract syntax tree.]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the case of interpretation, the second phase (called the execution phase) involves direct execution of the program by recursive evaluation of the abstract syntax tree. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>The description of data structures below assumes an interpreter is being designed</i>. This choice has been made to avoid target machine dependency in the documentation.  Notes/comments  are added wherever appropriate explaining the modifications to be made to the data structures to implement a compiler.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are three basic data structures that are maintained during the analysis phase. These are the following:
                            <ol>
                                <li> The <b>global symbol table</b> is used to store information about the global variables and functions in the program.</li>
                                <li>For each function, a separate <b>local symbol table</b> is maintained to store the information about local variables and  arguements of the function. </li>
                                <li>Finally, the <b>abstract syntax tree</b> that is constructed as the outcome of the analysis phase is the third data structure.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An abstract syntax tree is a tree representation of a program.  It is a generalization of the tree representation for expressions (called the expression tree).  For example, the arithmetic expression (3+5)*(5+9) is typically represented as an expression tree as below:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                <img src="img/data_structure_28.png" alt="" />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We can generalize this representation to come up with a tree representation for the whole sequence of statements of a ExpL function in a program.  Each funcion in an ExpL program will be represented by an abstract syntax tree.  Thus, the whole program will be a collection of abstract syntax trees, one for each function.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the following, the definitions node structures for each of the above data structures is discussed.  The organization of data in these data structures is also discussed with illustrative examples.

                        <h2>DATA STRUCTURES FOR EXECUTION PHASE</h2>
                        <p>
                            Before explaining the data structures used for the execution phase, it is necessary to understand the requirements and the underlying theoretical concepts in some detail.
                        </p>
                        <h4>The storage allocation Problem </h4>
                        <p>
                            This part of the documentation primarily focuses on program interpretation.   However, our interpreter will be somewhat mimicing the actions of a compiler and hence the reader will be able to easily adapt what is learned here to handle the synthesis phase of compilation by going through this documentation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An interpreter needs to "execute" the abstract syntax tree and hence the interpreter must arrange storage for run time data and subroutine invocations (function calls).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A program contains global variables as well as variables that are local to functions, both requiring memory space. Of these, global variables are the simplest to handle because during the analysis phase we know how many global variables are there in the program (all global variables are declared) and how much space needs to be allocated for each of them (why?). Thus, the storage requirements of global variables are completely determined at compile time and they can be assigned memory addresses during the analysis phase itself. Such allocation is called <b>static allocation</b>. The binding field of the global symbol table entry for a variable stores a pointer (address) to the memory allocated to the variable. The symbol table information will be used during the execution phase to find out the location in memory where the variable is stored.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            [In the case of compilation, the memory addresses for each global variable in the target machine is determined during the analysis phase and are stored in the <i>binding</i> field of the symbol table.]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a point aside, the binding field of the symbol table entry for a function is set to hold a <i>pointer to the abstract syntax tree of the function</i>. This helps the  evaluation phase to locate the corresponding abstract syntax tree whenever a function call is encountered during the execution phase.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            [In the case of a compiler, the the analysis phase will decide on the addresses in the <b>code area</b> of memory where the function's code is loaded.  The address to which a call to the function must be directed to is stored in the binding field of the symbol table.]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Variables which are local to functions demands more complicated allocation. This is because a function may be invoked several times and <i>for each invocation, separate storage needs to be allocated for variables defined within the scope of the function</i> (i.e., local variables and arguments).  [Why?] Moreover, we do not know during the analysis phase how many times a function will be invoked during the execution phase.  [Why?]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To understand this, consider the factorial program below.
                        </p>
                        <script src="js/f0127bf97757874e7cc2.js"></script>
                        <p>
                            The function factorial contains an argument n. Suppose the initial value of n input by the user at run time was 5, then factorial(n) with n=5 is invoked from the main. This function invokes factorial(n) with n=4. However, we need to retain the old value of n since the orginal factorial function must resume execution after the completion of factorial(4). Thus, we cannot statically assign a fixed memory address to the variable n. Instead, for each invocation of the function, we need to create a different memory space for storing the value of n. Moreover, the initial value of n given by the user is not known at compile time. Hence cannot determine at compile time the exact storage requirement. We will have to design the compiler/interpreter to allocate memory space as is necessary during run time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to allocating storage for  local variables and arguments, additional storage needs to be allocated at run time for each invocation of a function to store the return values of the call and control information like a pointer to the next instruction in the calling function (return address)].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The classical solution to handling function invocation is to maintain a <b>run time stack</b>. Whenever a function is invoked during execution, <b>an activation record</b> is created in the run time stack with sufficient space for storing local variables, arguments, return values and return address and the stack grows. Upon return from the function, the activation record is popped out of the stack and the activation record of the calling program will be in the top of the stack. Thus, at each point during execution, the activation record of the currently executing function will be on the top of the stack. Such storage allocation is called <b>stack based run time allocation</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            [Note:  The semantics of ExpL makes stack based allocation possible.  Primarily, this is possible because data stored in an activation record can be forgotten once the execution of the call is finished.    There are languages like LISP which permit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function">higher order functions</a> where a stack based run time allocation is not possible.  Languages which permit stack based run time allocation for function invocations are said to follow <b>stack discipline</b>.]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Observe  that for each function defined in an ExpL program, the amount of storage needed in its activation record is known during the analysis phase.  [Why?]   What is not known is how many activation records will have to be created in the stack as this is known only during execution time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to allocating storage for global variables and variables local to functions, ExpL supports <b>dynamic memory allocation</b> through the alloc() function. The alloc() function allows a program to request for memory space at run time. Since the amount of memory requested is not known during the analysis phase (why?), static allocation is not possible in this case. Stack allocation also is ruled out because memory allocated by alloc() inside a function is not de-allocated when the function returns. Hence, a mechanism to dynamically allocate memory on demand at run time is required.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The classical solution to this problem is to maintain an contiguous area of memory called the heap memory from which memory is allocated by alloc() on demand. Heap management algorithms like the <b>fixed size allocator algorithm</b> and the <b>buddy system algorithm</b> are explained in detail later in this documentation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, intermediate values generated during program execution needs <b>temporary storage</b>. For example, while evaluating an expression (a+b)*(c+d), the values of the sub-expressions (a+b) and (c+d) might need temporary storage. In a compiler, the <b>machine registers</b> are used for temporary storage.  Our interpreter will simulate the compiler by having an array of “registers” for storing such temporary values. When a function invokes another function, the registers in current use will be pushed to the stack (activation record of the caller) so that the called function (callee) has the full set of registers free for its use. Upon return from the callee, the values pushed into the stack are restored to the registers before the caller resumes its execution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To summarize, we have four kinds of memory allocation – static, stack, heap and register (temporary). The data structures and algorithms necessary for implementing each of these are discussed below.
                        </p>
                        <!--<p>
                             Compiler creates and manages a run-time environment in which a variety of issues such as allocation of storage locations for the objects named in the source program, the linkages between procedures, the mechanisms for passing parameters are taken care of. From the perspective of compiler writer, the executing target program has its own logical address space in which each program value has its location. Following is the representation of run-time memory.
                        </p>

                            Stack and heap are dynamic, their size changes as the program executes. We will discuss these structures in detail.

                        <p>
                            Our interpreter will simulate machine memory and registers by defining three memory arrays, named  <i>stack, heap and registers</i>.

                            The basic unit of memory (called a <b>memory word</b>) is assumed to be able to store an integer or a string.  This model is assumed because the primitive data types of ExpL are integer and string.  The interpreter therefore defines the following memory structure:

                        <p>
                            The interpreter works with three arrays of memory words, to implement temporary storage (registers), the run time stack and the heap. There will be no sperarate memory array for static data. Instead,  the intial part of the stack will be used for storing static data.
