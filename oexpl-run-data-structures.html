                      <h2>Virtual Function Table</h2>
                      <p>

                        <b>Virtual Function Table</b> is a run time data structure that is used to resolve at run time the
                        call addresses of methods in a class.  Such mechanism (or other table schemes) needs to be
                        implemented by compilers for languages that support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)">
                        inheritance</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping">subtype Polymorphism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_overriding">method over-riding</a>.
                        A run time virtual function table is maintained in the memory for each class.  <b>The compiler generates code
                        to initialize the table for each class such that each function that can be invoked from the class has an entry
                        in the table</b>.  For each function defined or inherited by a class, the table will contain the call address of
                        the function in the code region of memory. <b>If a function is inherited by a class from its parent and is
                        not over-ridden by the class, the call address stored
                         will be that of the function defined in the parent class</b>. The
                         same address will be stored for the function in the virtual function table of the parent class as well.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The OExpL compiler maintains a virtual function table of eight words for each class.  Hence, a class can have at most eight
                        member functions.  The i-th entry in the table holds the address of the i-th function of the class (identified by the
                        field <b>Funcposition</b> in the <a href="http://silcnitc.github.io/oexpl-data-structures.html">class table</a> - see Memberfunclist).
                         While generating code, <b>if there is a call to a function within a class, the compiler simply translates the call to "CALL [address]",
                          where address is obtained from the corresponding virtual function table</b>.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                         A simple way to place the virtual function table is to use the initial part of the stack region (starting at memory
                         address 4096), ahead of global variables. This is suggested because the compilation of classes will be
                         finished before compiling the global declarations.  In this scheme, the virtual function table of the class defined
                         first in the program will be stored in the region 4096-4103, the second in 4104-4111 and so on.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        When the compiler encounters the declaration of a variable of a class, it allocates <b>two words of storage</b> for the variable
                        (unlike other variables, where only one word of storage is allocated).
                        The first word is used to store the address of the memory area allocated in the heap for the class (eight words).
                        Space for member fields is allocated in the heap exactly as done with user defined types.
                        We will call this word the <b>member field pointer</b>.   <b>The second word is used to store the address of virtual function table</b>.
                        We will call this word the <b>virtual function table pointer</b>.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                      <b>  The key point to note here is that the virtual function pointer of a variable need not always point to the virtual function table of the class of the variable.  This is because a variable of a parent class can hold a reference to an object of any of its descendant classes.  In such cases, the virtual function pointer will hold the address of the descendant class.
    </b>
                      </p>


                      <p>
                        Hence, an assignment of a variable (of one class) to another variable (of the same class or an ancestor class) results in transfer of
                        the contents of both the pointers of one variable to the corresponding pointers of the other.
                         The <i>new</i> function sets the virtual function table pointer to the address of the virtual function table of the class specified as the argument to the new function.
                          A little bit of thought is necessary to reveal that this implementation will yield the correct execution semantics.
                      </p>

                             Storage for virtual function tables start at 4096 in the stack.  Eight consecutive words are allocated for storing the virtual function table of each class. Each word of virtual function table stores the call address of the corresponding function in the class. Thus, a class can contain atmost eight methods. Virtual function tables of various classes are stored in the order in which the classes are declared in the program. As noted earlier, we will allocate the space for global declarations after virtual function tables are allocated.

                              By using the <i>Class_index</i> field of the <a href="http://silcnitc.github.io/oexpl-data-structures.html">class_table</a> entry, the starting address of the virtual function table for that particular class can be computed using the formula  <b>4096 + (Class_index * 8)</b>.  The class defined first will have <i>Class_index</i> zero, the next will have one and so on.

                              Class B extends class A and over-rides f0().  Further, class B contains the newly defined method f2().  When a class extends another, all the member fields and methods of the parent class are inherited by the derived class, unless over-ridden by a new definition.  Since  the method f0() is over-ridden by B, a  new label will have to be allocated for the function f0() in class B.  In the present example, we set the new label to F2.  Accordingly, the compiler must update <i>Memberfunclist</i> entry of the method f0() in class B with the new  <i>flabel</i> value. Correspondingly, in the virtual function table entry for class B, the entry for method f0() must be F2 (over-riding F0).  The entry  for method f1() (label F1) will be inherited from class A.    A new label (label F3 in the example) must be generated for the function f2() defined in class B. The labels for each method in class B is shown in the table below for easy reference.

                          From an implementation point of view, it will be easier to (generate code to) copy all the virtual function table entries of A to the virtual function table of B and then (generate code to) modify the labels of over-ridden functions/add labels for new functions defined in B.  The compilation for class C may proceed similarly.  Note that OExpL specification stipulates that the signatures of the over-ridden methods must match exactly with the signature of the original definition in the parent class.

<!--
                            In class B, there are two methods f1() and f3() and it is extending class A. When a class extends other class,
                            all the member fields and methods of the parent class are inherited by the derived class. Suppose as in this example,
                            if the method signatures of the parent class and the derived class match, then method overriding occurs.
                            <br />
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_overriding">Method Overriding</a> means the definition of the method that belongs to
                            parent class is replaced by the definition of the method which is already present in the derived class.
                            Here, f1() method of class B overrides the f1() method of class A.
                            Let us see how the process of method overriding occurs, how the member function list is updated for the derived class.
                            This is demonstrated using the classes B and A of this OExpL program.

                            Here, class B is extending class A.
                            So, all the member fields and methods of class A is inherited by class B.

                           So, now the member function list looks as shown in the figure below.

                            <img />

                            Here method f1() derived from class A, will be overridden by the method f1() of class B.
                            As stated above, a new label will be alloted, for the f1() method of class B.
                            Now, we need to update the member func list entry of the f1() method in class B, by new flabel given to the method f1() of class B.
                            Similarly, the member func list for class C will be constructed.
                            The final class tables and corresponding member function lists are shown in the figure below.

    be identified at run time by looking up the label of the function f1() in the virtual function table to which the variable obj is bound to at run time.

                      <p> If (n < 0), the method f1() of the class A is invoked at run time. If (n = 0), the method f1() in the class B is invoked at run time and  If (n > 0), the method f1() in the class C is invoked at run time. So, Depending on the value of n, the variable obj must be bound to a different class.   Even though the three methods which are overridden has the same name f1(), the call addresses must be different in each case.  The information in the virtual function tables will be useful here.  </p>

                      <p> We noted earlier that the variable obj has two words of memory assigned to it at compile time - one member field pointer and one virtual function table pointer.
At run time, the member field pointer field of the variable obj is used to store a pointer to the space allocated in the heap as done in the previous stages.
The virtual function table pointer is used to store the start address of the virtual function table of the class assigned to obj at run time.  </p>

                    <p>
                      For instance,  obj = new(A) must result in the member field pointer of obj to be set to a newly allocated heap block and the virtual function table pointer to
be set to the start address of the virtual function table of class A.   Similarly, obj = new(B) must result in setting the virtual function table pointer of obj
to the base address of the virtual function table of class B.   Consequently, the compiler can resolve the call obj.f1() by generating code to
look up the label of the function f1() in the virtual function table pointed to by the virtual function table pointer field of obj.
</p>

    <h4> Actions during Compile Time </h4>

<ul>
  <li>

    <p> Referring to the above example, when the compiler encounters the statement obj=new(B), code is generated for the following:
a)  Call the library routine for Alloc to allocate heap memory.   The address returned is stored into the member field pointer of obj.
b)  Set the virtual function table pointer of obj to the base address of the virtual function table of the class B (i.e,  4104).
Note that before generating the code, compile time check whether B is a descendant class of the class of obj (in this case A) must be made.

</p>
</li>
<li>

<p> For the statement, obj.f1(), the compiler must do the following:
a)  Find the index of f1() in the class table of the class to which obj belongs to (Here obj is declared to be of class A.  The Funcposition of f1() in the class table entry of A will be 0.)
b)  Generate the code to get label of the function at index 0 from the virtual function table pointed to by the virtual function table pointer field of obj into a register (say R0).
c)  Generate code to push the "self object" into the stack as argument (i.e., the member field pointer of obj and the virtual function table pointer of obj must be pushed as arguments to the call to f1() -
See function call convention for methods.)
d)  Generate code to call the function using the label obtained in step b.  (call R0).
Note that compile time check whether f1() is a method in the class A to which obj is declared to must be done before proceeding to code generation.

</p>
</li>
</ul>


<h4> Run time Stack Management for Method invocations </h4>

<p>
When generating the code for invoking a method of a class using an object of the class (for example, in the call obj.f1() above, f1() is invoked using the object obj  of class A)
the member field pointer and virtual function table pointer of the object must be pushed to the stack in addition to normal arguments of the function.
We will follow the convention that these two values will be pushed before other arguments are pushed.

This is how the runtime stack looks, when a method of a class is called.

 For instance, in the above example, if the value read from the input is 0, the following figure shows the run time stack.

<h6>Need For Pushing The Object : </h6>



<p>

According to OExpL Specification, a member field or method should be accessed using self.

In order to find out which object we are talking about,when we say self, we need to push the object into the stack.

</p>

<p>

Consider the following OExpL program,

<br>

  <script src="../js/55aeef67b003d48dd45db379b46a4631.js"></script>

</p>

<p>

  For <b>obj1</b>, the member field <b>height</b> must be set to 10.
For <b>obj2</b>, the member field <b>height</b> must be set to 20.
</p>

<p>

In the method definition for the method <b>setHeight</b>, the member field <b>height</b> is set by using the statement,


 <b>self.height = a;</b>.

 <br>


By this statement alone, we cannot say which object is <b>self</b> referring to.

To identify which object is <b>self</b> referring to, we push the calling object to the stack.

</p>

<p>

If <b>obj1</b> calls the method <b>setHeight</b>, the member field pointer and virtual function table pointer of <b>obj1</b> are pushed into the stack.
Now, we know that <b>obj1</b> is calling the method (By looking at the runtime stack).
So, we set the <b>member field height of obj1</b> by using the <b>member field pointer</b> and the <b>field position of member field height</b>.

Member field pointer is the heap address given to the object for storing the member fields of the class it is assigned with.

</p>
<p>
The virtual function table pointer is used, when we invoke other methods using <b>self</b>.

  <b>p = self.setHeight(5); </b> //In the method defaultHeight().

  <br>

For this we need to generate a CALL instruction.
The call address is obtained from virtual function table.

</p>

</p>



                      <h2>Resolving Strategy</h2>

                      For every class variable, generally one block of memory in stack is allocated for storing the heap address.
                      But with the introduction of subtyping, we face the problem of resolution of which method to call as shown in the example
                      <a href="http://silcnitc.github.io/oexpl-run-data-structures.html#nav-runtimebinding"> mainfunc.txt </a>.
                      So, now to resolve this we use virtual function table and every class variable will be allocated two blocks of memory.
                      One block is used to store the heap address and the other block is used to store the starting address of the virtual function table.

                      <h4> During Compile Time</h4>

                      In the example <a href="http://silcnitc.github.io/oexpl-run-data-structures.html#nav-runtimebinding"> mainfunc.txt </a>, when compiler reaches the statement, <b>obj.f1()</b>, it checks the type of obj, which means
                      to which class the <b>obj</b> belongs to. Then it gets the member function list of the class of that object and checks if there
                      is any method with name <b>f1</b>. If it finds a method, it proceeds with the compilation. If it doesn't find, then it is a
                      compilation error.

                      When it encounters the statement, <b> obj = new(A);</b>, the second block of object is set.
                      The second block of the object is to be set with the starting address of virtual function table of a class.
                      So, here,
                      (4096 + class_index * 8) is the starting address of virtual function table of the required class. The class_index is that of the class
                      that is present in new. So, for <b>obj = new(A);</b> 4096 is stored because class index of A is 0. Similarly, for class B, 4104 is stored.
                      For class C, 4112 is stored.
                      When the compiler encounters a call statement, from the second block of A we get start address of virtual function table,
                      and funcposition is obtained from the member function table of class to which this object belongs to.
                      Both are added and the value present in that address(flabel) is stored in a register.
                      Then a call to the register is made.

                      <h4>During Run Time</h4>

                      if '( n < 0)' then the two words of obj is : <br />
                      <a href="../img/virtual_function_table_5.png">  <img src="../img/virtual_function_table_5.png"></img></a><br />
                      if '(n = 0)' then the two words of obj is : <br />
                      <a href="../img/virtual_function_table_6.png">  <img src="../img/virtual_function_table_6.png"></img></a><br />
                      if '(n > 0)' then the two words of obj is : <br />
                      <a href="../img/virtual_function_table_7.png">  <img src="../img/virtual_function_table_7.png"></img></a><br />

                      During run time, only one if will be executed. That means by the completion of if,else block, required values are set,
                      and the call to the required function is made.
