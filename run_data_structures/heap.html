                            A storage allocation decision can be static or dynamic. A decision is dynamic if it can be decided only while the program executes. In simple terms, consider the previous example, the size of the linkedlist marks is not known at the compile time, its size is only known at the run-time when we read in the count of subjects.

                        <p>
                            In this algorithm, the chunk size allocated is fixed. Lets call the fixed size as HB_SIZE, say 8. The heap is considered here as a list of blocks of HB_SIZE.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first block in the list is reserved. Initially, the first index of reserved block stores the index of first free block. The first index of every free block stores the index of next available free block. The last block stores -1 in the first index. This is how it looks initially(after the call to initialise function).

                        <h2>Buddy Memory Allocation</h2>
                        <p>
                            In this technique, memory is divided into partitions to try to satisfy a memory request as suitably as possible. This technique makes use of splitting memory into halves to give a best-fit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every memory block in this technique has an order, a number ranging from 0 to a specified upper limit. The size of block of order n is 2<sup>n</sup>. So the blocks are exacly twice the size of blocks of one order lower. Power-of-two block sizes makes address computation simple, because all buddies are aligned on memory address boundaries that are powers of two. When a larger block is split, it is divided into two smaller blocks, and each smaller block becomes a unique <b>buddy</b> to the other. A split block can only be merged with its unique buddy block, which then reforms the larger block they were split from.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Starting off, the size of the smallest possible block is determined, i.e. the smallest memory block that can be allocated. The smallest block size is then taken as the size of an order-0 block, so that all higher orders are expressed as power-of-two multiples of this size. In our implementation, we consider the smallest memory block size to be 8. So, the memory block sizes will be 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. In our implementation, we take the heap of size 1024.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In our implementation, we have a heap of size 1024. The smallest block size possible in the heap is 8 (order 0). The highest block size of 2<sup>n</sup> that is free is 1024.We maintain a free list for all possible block sizes. So we have freelists for sizes 8,16,32,64,128,256,512 and 1024, i.e, we maintain eight freelists.
                            <ul>
                                <li>We have only one block of size 1024 and so the size of freelist for 1024 is 1(2<sup>0</sup>).</li>
                                <li>In the 1024 sized heap, we have two blocks of size 512. Note that, both blocks cannot be free at the same time. If both blocks are free, they will be merged to a free block of size 1024(whose information will be maintained in the freelist for blocks of 1024 size). So at a time, maximum number of blocks that are free of size 512 is 1 ( 2<sup>0</sup>).</li>
                                <li>Similarly in case of blocks of size 256, 1024 sized heap has 4 blocks of size 256 (say a,b,c and d in their respective order).a and b are buddies of each other, of which both cannot be free at a time due to merging, so only one of them can be free. Similarly in case of c and d, only one of them can be free. 1 + 1 , 2 ( 2<sup>1</sup>) is the maximum size of free list for blocks of 256.</li>
                                <li>Similarly, there are 8 blocks of 128 in 1024 (a,b,c,d,e,f,g and h). (a,b)(c,d)(e,f)(g,h) are buddy pairs and only one of each pair can be free. So the maximum size of freelist for blocks of 128 is 4 ( 2<sup>2</sup>).</li>
                                <li>Similarly, the maximum size of freelist for blocks of sizes 64,32,16 and 8 are 8 ( 2<sup>3</sup>),16( 2<sup>4</sup>),32( 2<sup>5</sup>) and 64( 2<sup>6</sup>) respectively.</li>
                            </ul>
                            So, the size of the complete freelist is 2<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 2<sup>5</sup> +2<sup>6</sup> = 128.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will maintain the freelist inside the heap, So initially we won't have the complete heap of 1024 free. So we need not require a freelist for size 1024. We will store the complete freelist in a 128 sized block. Therefore, initially we have the first 128 block(0-127) of the heap reserved for freelist maintainence. Then we have a 128 sized free block(128-255), then a 256 block(256-511) and then a free block of 512 size(512-1023). Following is the diagrammatic representation of the heap initial status.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The free-list in the heap has to be initialised as above. Also, the first index of each allocated block through alloc function will store the size of allocated block. This is to figure out the size that has been allocated when the dealloc function is called for a variable, which provides only the starting address of the block that has been allocated.

                                    <li>If not, it tries to make a suitable memory slot by following the below steps

                                            <li>Split a the <b>next larger suitable free memory slot</b> into half.(Remove the next larger suitable free memory slot from it free list and add both the halves to the corresponding freelist).(Note : of there is no larger free memory slot - return -1 indicating that no free space is available).</li>
                                            <li>If the required size 'B' is reached, one of the halves is allocated to the program.</li>
                                            <li>Else go to the step a and repeat it until the memory slot of required size 'B' is found.</li>

                            For a better understanding purpose, we will have a simple illustration of how heap memory looks like through a set of some allocations and deallocations.

                            For illustration, we will have 64-sized heap and smallest block size as 8. So we free lists for sizes 8,16 and 32 of lengths 4 ,2 and 1. So we will use a 8-size block to store the free-list.

                                    The heap looks initially as follows.

                                    Request for memory of size 5. Lets call this request as A. The nearest 2^k value for 5 is 8. We search for a 8 sized free block. We have one such! Allocate it!

                                    Next we will have a reuqest B of size 14.

                                    Now we have a request C of size 7.
